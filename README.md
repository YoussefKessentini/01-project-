business network platform
01 is a project who tries to solve the common problems nowadays because of the corona virus 
Actually he solve two problems:
0-The economical interruption that comes to the companies and the majority of the business in the world and in Tunisia.
1-People who had a project in mind but don't have the possibility to make their dream real.

How to solve the 2 problems:
This platform allows us to create a new digital project or transform an existent project from brick-and-mortar Company to a digital one which called digitalization. But how 
well u start by creating a profile containing full name, email, CV file, your occupation and other it is necessary because it introduce you to the users of the platform (right clicking the get started button u go to signup page or by the navigation bar)
then choose between digitizing your business or create new one (plus if you donâ€™t want none of them you can just take courses and discuss with others about them to help better understanding)(you choose in the navigation bar)
After that choose human resources in the research section (you choose by selecting the job and the age)
Then contact your human resources and discuss with them about either paying them or making them partners in the business.
When you see eye to eye u can give them access to the data related t your project.
Then Start using the courses in the shop section and discussing with your employees or partners to build strong digital process
Then launch your business.
You can invite your friends to join our community and be entrepreneurs together and start making real money.

Benefits of the 01:
-get into the digital world (btw ecommerce has won the battle between all types of business so if you choose this path you are already a winner)
-respect the quarantine and make money at the same time(believe me if you get out of this quarantine without starting a new job  and learn new skills you waste not only time but also opportunities)
-get in touch with a lot of people with high skills and experience.
-if you still young and inexperienced, you have the possibility to talk to experts in trades and all the digital stuff plus the extraordinary courses paid and unpaid)
-get encouraged because all members you choose to be your partners or workers are near your local (well the app is Tunisian so u will contact with Tunisian)
-for the business owners, they will get your income back maybe more than usual. Plus it is an occasion to digitalize your work. Its benefit lasts even after this panic.

Why this name:
- Because digital and numeric mean 0 and 1 language of computers.
-besides it is the first Tunisian platform with this type of service.
-and we come here and build this platform to be number 01 in the "hack the virus" and we will as a first achievement for our project.
